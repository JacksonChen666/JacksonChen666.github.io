Q: How is this made?<br>

Q: Why do I need to enable JavaScript to run?<br>
A: This was originally created on JavaScript, and the only way to change elements in HTML is using JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Q: How are the files saved?<br>
A: The editor heavily relies on local storage. Clearing your local storage will clear all text entered on the editor, and switching to another browser shows an empty box instead. Text you entered on one site does not transfer to another site.
