Q: How is this made?<br>
A: This was inspired by the Real Time HTML editor by someone else who had alread made. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onLsz9BwP7M">You can find it here.</a>
</p>
<p>
Q: Why do I need to enable JavaScript to run?<br>
A: This was originally created on JavaScript, and the only way to change elements in HTML is using JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
Q: How are the files saved?<br>
A: The editor heavily relies on local storage. Clearing your local storage will clear all text entered on the editor, and switching to another browser shows an empty box instead. Text you entered on one site does not transfer to another site. You can now also save the HTML code as file.

A: I have been attempting to allow tab indenting, but it seems like that the methods I have been trying does not work.
